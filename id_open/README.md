An Arduino/ESP32 class to act as a wrapper around opendroneid.

Runs on a cheap ESP32 dev board.

Needs opendroneid.c, opendroneid.h and odid_wifi.h from opendroneid. The wifi.c in this directory is slightly modified from the one in opendroneid.

Bluetooth

Tested against the opendroneid Android app.

WiFi

Needs testing, but I am not aware of an app to test it against.
